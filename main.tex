\begin{abstract}

Software companies are increasingly adopting continuous software engineering practices to support short feedback loops, gain better control and visibility over deployments, and decrease the need for manual work with the help of automated processes. While adopting continuous practices can lead to various benefits, companies also face many kinds of challenges in the transition. We conducted a case study in a large Danish software service house about their experiences of transitioning towards continuous deployment. We got 30 completed online survey responses and interviewed four persons working in roles related to software engineering. Identified challenges were mainly organizational, often requiring restructuring of internal departments.

\section{PROCEDURE FOR PAPER SUBMISSION}

\subsection{Selecting a Template (Heading 2)}




%\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}
%Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if you filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

%It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.


%\subsection{Figures and Tables}

%Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

%\begin{table}[h]
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
%\end{table}


%   \begin{figure}[thpb]
%      \centering
%      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
%}
%}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
%      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
%       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
%      \label{figurelabel}
%   \end{figure}
   

%Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó


\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
